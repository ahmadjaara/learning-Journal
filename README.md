## what I learned ? 
-I learned how to make a test to validate my function using TDD method which I write the test first then I write my code
and testing my code like this will help me to prevent complexity happen when i don't test my code part by part and then my code stuck

who write the test ?

- a group of tester (developers)

- or you as a developer try to build your own test


- in the test file you will import the module and name of function you want to test

- the name of tests function should start with test word  to check expected value with actual we use assert function  


- also I learned how to write the white board challenge and try to think how I can reduce the time and space in the memory when try to  come up with the solution
